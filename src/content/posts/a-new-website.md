Considering that BeerJS has been around for a while, it's about time we got a website. To date, the number one question
I get whenever I mention BeerJS is: "Does BeerJS have a website?"

Well, now we do! üéâ

## Why a new website?

While GitHub may be a good place to organize a meetup, websites are more discoverable and feel more user-friendly to
most. If we are to grow the community, we need to make it easier for people to find us.

I feel the idea behind BeerJS deserves much more attention than it currently gets. It's cool that every BeerJS branch
does its own thing, but it can be confusing to newcomers. I hope this website will help people understand what BeerJS is
and how they can get involved. On top of that, I hope that it will help people start new BeerJS branches in their
cities.

Since BeerJS is as good as its community, I invite every BeerJS organizer to contribute to the website. Branch news,
events, and blog posts relevant to BeerJS are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please submit a PR on the
[website repo](https://github.com/beerjs/beerjs-website).

## Features

Besides being an "info board" for all things BeerJS, the website also has some cool features:

- [Branch Locator](/location) - A simple search that will help you find a BeerJS branch nearby.
- [Starter Kit](/starter-kit) - A guide on how to start a BeerJS branch in your city. It aims to be a one-stop shop for
  everything you need to know to get started.

## What's next?

I'm glad you asked! Here are some of the things I'd like to see on the website in the future:

- An improved branch locator that will allow for more sophisticated searches.
- An interactive map showing all BeerJS branches so that people can easily find the one closest to them.
- Your idea? PRs are welcome!

## Stack

The website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), some
[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com) and a bit of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style) thrown into the mix. It's hosted on
[CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). You can find the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/beerjs/beerjs-website). PRs are welcome, as well as ideas for new features and improvements.
