## JS, Community, and Beer

BeerJS is not just a meetup; it's a global community where the love for JavaScript and a good brew come together. Born
from a simple yet powerful concept, BeerJS serves as a melting pot for ideas, collaboration, and networking among
JavaScript enthusiasts, developers, and tech aficionados.

In general, each BeerJS branch does its own thing. Some meet monthly for drinks, and others have conference-style
events. More than anything, BeerJS is an idea - a way to bring people together to talk about web development over a
beer. Beer consumption is, of course, not required to take part.

Sounds fun? [Join us](/starter-kit)!

## Start a BeerJS in your city

If there's no BeerJS where you are, we have a [starter kit](/starter-kit) for that! It's easy and fun, and we'll help
you get started.

## BeerJS on Slack

We have a Slack team! [Join us](https://beers-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)! It's currently the easiest way to get in
touch with us, in addition to GitHub issues.
